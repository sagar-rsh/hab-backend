# HAB-Backend (User Service)

**Backend service for user authentication, subscription management, and access control in the Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) Detection System.**

This service is built using **Python FastAPI** and acts as the **user-facing API gateway** to an external HAB prediction microservice.  
It handles authentication, subscription tier enforcement, request forwarding, and administrative functions.

## üìå Features

- **User Authentication & Management**
  - Secure registration with password hashing
  - Login with JWT-based session tokens
  - Storage of user and subscription data in Google Cloud Firestore

- **Tiered Subscription System**
  - Free, Tier 1, and Tier 2 plans
  - API call limits enforced per tier
  - Premium features (image-based HAB detection) for Tier 1 & Tier 2

- **Prediction Request Proxy**
  - Validates user tier and call limits
  - Forwards authorized requests to the external prediction microservice
  - Supports:
    - Geospatial data predictions (all tiers)
    - Image-based predictions (Tier 1 & Tier 2 only)

- **Subscription Upgrade Workflow**
  - Users can submit upgrade requests via a financial aid form
  - Upgrade requests stored in Firestore for admin review
  - Admin approval updates user tier and access limits

- **Administrative Endpoints**
  - View all users, subscriptions, and pending upgrades
  - Approve or reject tier upgrade requests

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application is structured as follows:

```
app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/                 # Authentication & authorization logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/               # Pydantic models for request/response validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routers/              # Route handlers (auth, subscriptions, predictions, admin)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/             # Business logic (e.g., prediction forwarding, tier enforcement)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database/             # Firestore integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/                # Helper functions (JWT creation, password hashing, etc.)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py               # FastAPI entry point
```

## üîÑ Application Flow

1. **Registration & Login**
   - Register: create user & subscription records in Firestore (free tier, 0 calls used)
   - Login: verify credentials, issue JWT

2. **Authenticated Requests**
   - JWT is required in the `Authorization` header
   - Token validation is performed on every protected route

3. **Making a Prediction**
   - Check subscription tier & call usage
   - Forward request to prediction backend with API key
   - Increment usage count in Firestore
   - Return prediction result to user

4. **Subscription Upgrades**
   - User submits upgrade request (financial aid form)
   - Request stored in Firestore as `pending`

5. **Admin Review**
   - Admin views pending requests
   - Approve: tier is updated in Firestore
   - Reject: status updated, no tier change
